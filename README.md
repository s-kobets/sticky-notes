## Sticky Notes

Your task is to implement a single-page web application for sticky notes. You are required to implement at least 3 of the following 4 features:

1. Create a new note of the specified size at the specified position.
2. Change note size by dragging.
3. Move a note by dragging.
4. Remove a note by dragging it over a predefined "trash" zone.

You are encouraged to think about the best UI for these features that is possible to implement in the specified timeframe.

I. Entering/editing note text.
II. Moving notes to front (in case of overlapping notes).
III. Saving notes to local storage (restoring them on page load).
IV. Different note colors.
V. Saving notes to REST API. Note: you're not required to implement the API, you can mock it, but the mocks should be asynchronous.
